# ELMFS
Euston Leisure Message Filtering Service (ELMFS) is coursework for SET09102 at Edinburgh Napier University Software Engineering Year 3.
This involves handling different types of messages such as SMS, Emails and Tweets and writing the inputs to a JSON formatted file. 

# Motivation
ELMFS is coursework for the Edinburgh Napier Software Engineering course and is a requirement. Not only is this part of a portfolio for myself, but also a milestone in my own personal developemnt.
At a later date, I may develop something further or merely use certain components as templates and help.
